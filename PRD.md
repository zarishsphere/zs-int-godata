## 3. Platform Context

This repository is part of the **ZarishSphere** sovereign digital health operating platform — a free, open-source, FHIR R5-native system for South and Southeast Asia.

**Non-negotiable constraints:**
- Zero cost — all tooling must use genuinely free tiers
- FHIR R5 native — all clinical data modelled as FHIR R5 resources
- Offline-first — must work without network connectivity
- No-coder friendly — GUI-first, template-driven
- Documentation as Code — all decisions in GitHub

---

## 4. Goals & Objectives

- Bridge ZarishSphere FHIR R5 data with GODATA system
- Implement bidirectional data exchange where specified
- Provide robust error handling and retry logic

## 5. Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|----|------------|---------|
| F-01 | Bidirectional data exchange (or directional as specified) | P0 |
| F-02 | Configurable mapping between GODATA and FHIR R5 | P0 |
| F-03 | Error handling with dead letter queue (NATS) | P0 |
| F-04 | Retry with exponential backoff | P0 |
| F-05 | FHIR AuditEvent for all data exchanges | P1 |
| F-06 | Integration test with testcontainers-go | P0 |
